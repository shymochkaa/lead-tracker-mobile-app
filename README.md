## About the Project
This Chrome extension project was developed as part of the **Frontend Developer Career Path** on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com). Through this project, I practiced core web development concepts, Chrome extension APIs, and basic data storage techniques.

## Features
- **Save URLs**: Quickly save and organize leads directly from the browser
- **Simple Interface**: User-friendly design for easy access and lead management
- **Local Storage**: Data is saved locally, so leads persist between sessions

## Installation
To install the extension locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shymochkaa/lead-tracker.git
   ```

2. Open **Chrome** and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable **Developer mode** by toggling it on in the top-right corner
4. Click on **Load unpacked** and select the `lead-tracker` folder where this project is located
5. The extension should now be added to your browser, and you can see its icon in the Chrome toolbar

## Usage

1. Click on the Lead Tracker icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the extension
2. Use the provided interface to:
   - Add new URLs (leads) by typing them into the input field and clicking the **Save** button
   - View a list of all saved URLs
   - Clear all saved leads when they are no longer needed
3. The saved leads will be stored locally, so they remain available even after closing the browser

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
